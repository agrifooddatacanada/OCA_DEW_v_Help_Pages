  <p>
    This is a summary of the schema you have been creating. You can tab through multiple languages (if you have more than one) to see all the schema information for each language.
  </p>
  <p>
    To back and edit any of the entries use the back button to go through the schema writer and make your necessary changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you Finish and Export your schema you will create two files. The first will be the machine-readable version of your schema. The second will be the human-readable .txt version of your schema. We suggest you keep these two files together so that both machines and humans can understand your schema.

  <h3>OCA is expressed in JSON</h3>
  <p>
    Overlays Capture Architecture is a machine-readable way to encode a schema expressed in the JSON scripting language. You can view the JSON file contents of the schema bundle using a text editor such as Notepad in Windows but since JSON files do not usually contain line breaks it is easier to read using a dedicated JSON viewer.

  <h3>Advantages of OCA</h3>
  <p>
    The advantage of OCA schemas is that they are modular. You can start with a very simple design, and because of the OCA layered architecture you can add more functionality to the schema later. The simplest OCA schema has a Capture Base (CB) which defines the basic structure of the data, and some additional overlays (OL) that help the user understand the data. OCA schemas are also shareable and machine-readable. You can publish your OCA schema with an identifier and others can reference and extend your work.
