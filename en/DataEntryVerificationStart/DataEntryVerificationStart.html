  <br>
  <p>The data verifier allows you to view your data, make changes to your data, verify your data against the rules described by the schema, and export your data in either Excel or .csv format.</p>
    <h2>Required: Add schema</h2>
    <p>Add your schema bundle that you wish to use to either enter data, or verify existing data. Your schema bundle contains all the rules that you will verify your dataset with. You must add a data schema to use the tool.</p>
  <p>After you have added a schema you can proceed directly to the next step where you can enter data according to the rules of the schema.</p>
    <h2>Optional: Add Data</h2>
    <p>You may also choose to add existing data to the tool, either to continue to add data, or to verify data that you have created. You can either add an Excel spreadsheet or .csv file. Ensure that the headers are always in the first row. When you add an Excel spreadsheet you can select which specific sheet you want to use for verification.</p>
    <h2>Click Next</h2>
    <p>After you have selected and previewed your schema (and optional dataset) click next.</p>
