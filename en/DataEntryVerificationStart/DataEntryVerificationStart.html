  <br>
  <p>The data verifier allows you to view your data, make changes to your data, verify your data against the rules described by the schema, and export your data in either Excel or .csv format. By hovering over the ? in each column you can view the specific rules for each attribute of your dataset. If a column is in grey it is not matched to a schema attribute and cannot be verified.</p>
    <h2>Switch Languages</h2>
    <p>If your schema is desribed with multiple languages you can view the different versions using the language selector.</p>
    <h2>View only row with errors</h2>
    <p>After you have verified your data, you can navigate through the errors by selecting to view only those rows with errors (for different features).</p>
    <h2>Verify</h2>
    <p>When you click on the button, your data is verified against the rules described in the schema. Cells highlighted in green are those that have passed the verification test, and red indicates a verification failure. You can go directly into your dataset and correct errors.</p>
  <h2>Export Data</h2>
  <p>No data is saved when you are working with data in the Data Verifier. To get your data you must export it. When you export you can choose to export in .csv or in Excel. When exporting in Excel you will have your data in one sheet and a second sheet will describe the data schema. When you export in .csv you will have the option to either keep your original headers when you uploaded the data, or to change your headers to be consistent with the schema. It may be helpful to change headers to match the schema so that the attribute matching can be automated.</p>
